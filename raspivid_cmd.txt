run this command in the terminal in its most basic form:

	raspivid  -o - -t 0 -hf -w 640 -h 360 -fps 25 -l tcp://PI-IP_ADDRESS:PORT

raspivid automatically connects to the rasberry pi camera interface if it is enabled

-o sets the output of the captured video. '-' references standard output i.e. the screen

-hf flips the image horizontally before sending to output

-w, -h are the dimensions of the image in pixels

-l option sets the raspberry pi server to listen for connections to its port

for more options, e.g. size of roi or codec to use. go to https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md
